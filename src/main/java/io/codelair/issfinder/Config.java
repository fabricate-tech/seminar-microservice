/**
 * Supplies configuration to this small application.
 * <p>
 * It uses the {@code MP-Config} API to inject configuration values; which, in turn, can be supplied through Java Properties,
 * Operating System environment variables, or by any other means supported by the container being used (such as YAML-files, properties-
 * files, et cetara).
 * <p>
 * The config values read by this class are {@code VANTAGE_POINT_LATITUDE} and {@code VANTAGE_POINT_LONGITUDE} and default to the center
 * of Stockholm, Sweden.
 * <p>
 * This class is marked as {@code Serializable} and the relevance for this in a single non-clustered Über-JAR-deployment is questionable;
 * nevertheless, when deploying this application in a cluster or running the Über-JARs in cluster-mode, we want to have the code by the
 * book.
